## Guidelines

- The source code is in folder **src**.
- The production code(with minified code) is in directory **dist**.
- Run the `index.html` from **dist** directory.
- For viewing the source code, refer the **src** directory.


## Optimizations made to `index.html`

- Fonts css made to load asynchronously.
- Style css made internal rather than external.
- `Media="print"` added for `print.css`.
- Optimized jpeg files `img/profilepic.jpg` and `views/images/pizzeria.jpg`.
- Set the JS files to `async`.
- Moved Google Analytics `<script>` file to bottom of `<body>`.
